Classification of 1-relator groups appeared in the enumeration of AK3 example

Here we store the results of classification performed for the section 5 of "Panteleev, Ushakov CONJUGACY  SEARCH  PROBLEM  AND THE ANDREWS-CURTIS CONJECTURE". 

Several files can be found in the Releases section:
1. [ak3_typed.txt](https://github.com/stevens-crag/ak3_types/releases/download/v1.0/ak3_typed.txt.gz) - list of words appeared in the enumeration of AK3 classified by simple properties of the associatied 1-relator group - C1/6 and simple instances of BS-kind groups
2. [automatic.txt](https://github.com/stevens-crag/ak3_types/releases/download/v1.0/automatic.txt.gz) - subset of (1) recognized as automatic by [kbmag](http://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~mareg/download/kbmag2/) utility
3. [bs.txt](https://github.com/stevens-crag/ak3_types/releases/download/v1.0/bs.txt.gz) subset of (1) of  ```X^n*Y*X^M*Y^-1``` kind where X and Y are some words. 
4. [unknown.txt.gz](https://github.com/stevens-crag/ak3_types/releases/download/v1.0/unknown.txt.gz) subset of (1) which we failed to classify.
